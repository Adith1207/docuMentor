Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and flexibility. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.

The print() function is used to display output in the console. Python uses indentation (spaces or tabs) to define code blocks.

Here is a simple example:

def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet("Alice")

Python is widely used for web development, data science, automation, and AI applications.
